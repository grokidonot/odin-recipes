    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna with a Canadian twist.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch spinach, washed and chopped</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound ground moose</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13 inch pan with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook onions and garlic in oil until tender and semi-transparent. Stir in mushrooms, and cook until soft. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a sauce pan, combine spinach and 1/4 cup water. Cover, and cook over medium heat until wilted. Drain. In a large bowl, mix together spinach, onion mixture, and ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>In a frying pan, brown moose meat over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. When the pink color is almost gone, stir in the cocoa and brown sugar. This removes the gamey-ness. Once the meat is well browned, drain to remove excess grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and water, and season with oregano, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Arrange a single layer of oven ready noodles over the sauce. Spread one half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, and top with some of the tomato sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. Cover pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Bake for 45 minutes, or until lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
